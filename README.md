The ButtonCheck is now known as Skybound Arts, which is a video archiving website created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, C#, and ASP .NET Core.

This contains the front-end code that Skybound Arts has been written with.

By running `npm start`, the program will run on http://localhost:3000 and the view will be displayed in the browser.

Currently, the only view that this site has been optimized for is iPhone 6/7/8 Plus.

As the launch of this site comes closer (February 2020 release), this will certainly be
optimized for Desktop and other views - as well as utilizing a fully-functional backend.
